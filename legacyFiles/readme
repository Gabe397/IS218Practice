The files in this folder are ones that were created and used in the program before but are no longer needed.
Some like file.php were integral to the code but were replaced with newer classes and more efficient/appropriate code.
There are kept in here in case something goes wrong in the program in the future and we need to look back on it or
if we just need to refer back to this code for a certain reason.
